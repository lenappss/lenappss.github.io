# Soundscape Synthesizer with MAX MSP

---

## Description

This project aims to develop a prototype soundscape synthesizer using MAX MSP, focusing on additive and vector synthesis techniques to create immersive soundscapes. The technical implementation involves MAX MSP for sound synthesis and research materials such as Cipriani’s book "Electronic music and sound design in MAX MSP". The goal is to explore advanced sound design techniques and lay the groundwork for future research and development in immersive audio experiences and building a functional experemental synth.

## Context and Related Work

This project is inspired by foundational sound synthesis techniques like additive and vector synthesis, as well as related works such as *Electronic Music and Sound Design* by A. Cipriani. It builds upon existing synthesis methods and aims to extend them by creating a unique tool for immersive sound design, with potential applications in experimental music and A/V art.

## Results

### Overview
Here is a summary of the key results:
- Functional additive and vector synthesis modules in MAX MSP.
- Basic soundscapes with adjustable parameters.
- Research insights from Cipriani’s book.

### Creative / Artistic Development
The project focuses on designing a tool for creating immersive soundscapes, blending sound in a coherent and artistic way. The synthesizer allows users to craft unique auditory experiences and explore experimental music.

### Software Development
The synthesizer is implemented in MAX MSP, with modules for additive and vector synthesis. The additive synthesis module enables users to create complex sounds by combining multiple sine waves, while the vector synthesis module allows morphing between sound sources for dynamic sound evolution.

### Research / Experimentation
Research includes studying synthesis techniques from Cipriani’s book and combing learnt technics into more complex system. Experimentation focuses on effective ways to control and modulate sound parameters, such as amplitude, frequency, and blending ratios.

## Discussion of Results

The results demonstrate the feasibility of creating a soundscape synthesizer using MAX MSP. The additive and vector synthesis modules provide a solid foundation for generating immersive soundscapes, while the research offers valuable insights into advanced sound design techniques. Challenges included the steep learning curve of MAX MSP and the complexity of combining modules into coherent functional system.

## Next Steps and Future Work

Future work could expand the synthesizer with additional synthesis methods (e.g., granular, subtractive, FM synthesis) and enhance interactivity. The ultimate goal is to develop a full-fledged soundscape synthesizer for live performances and installations, potentially serving as a reference for building a physical version of the synthesizer.

### Reflection on Technical Choices
- **Why did you make the choices you made?** MAX MSP was chosen for its flexibility in sound synthesis and its suitability for prototyping.
- **What worked well, what didn’t?** The additive and vector synthesis modules were successfully implemented, but some advanced features (e.g., global modulation) were not fully realized due to time constraints.
- **What would you do differently next time?** generally I am happy with my work and that I was prepared enough for this specific project because I spent enough time for learning basics of MAX MSP and sounds synthesis.

### Reflection on MVP and Best-Case Scenario Plans
- **What did you achieve, and what didn’t you achieve?** The baseline solution (additive and vector synthesis modules) was achieved, but the best-case solution (polished synthesizer with advanced controls and integration of VVVV) was not fully realized.
- **Why were some goals not met?** Time constraints and the complexity of implementing advanced features.

### Challenge of Your Comfort Zone
- **What was new for you, and what did you learn?** Deepening knowledge of MAX MSP, as well as exploring advanced sound design techniques.
- **What was the most difficult part of the project?** combining all smaller modules into one system.

### Reflection on Original Work Plan and Timeline
- **Did you follow your plan?** The plan was mostly followed, but some advanced features were not fully implemented.
- **If not, why not?** Time constraints and the complexity of the tasks.
